## Description

This is a simple password/string Hasher for CS 3090 Ethics in Computing at the University of Utah. It is not meant for real use in security. Meant to be more of an example of what a password hasher may look like and do. It will ask the user for an input string and hash the given input to create a 32 byte array and print it as a hexidecimal value back to the user.

## How to use

This program is very simple and doesn't need anything outside the PasswordHasher.java file to work. It can be ran in the terminal and when run it will prompt the user for a password/string and produce a 32 byte hashed value printed back to the user in hexidecimal format. All you need is the PasswordHasher.java file which you can run in whichever environment you would like and it will prompt the user for input and produce the hash.

## Limitations and Warnings

This is a very simple string hasher and is not meant for real use in computer security. It was build solely for eductional purposes and experience. It is not a secure hash algorithm and has serious limitations meaning it should not be used in real security scenarios. Its purpose for being created was to learn about hashing and the process of putting software publicly on github with an open source license.

## Ethical Considerations and Responsibilities use

Using this program for real security purposes is NOT the intended use and should not be used in any real security scenario. It has not be tested and build for real use and should not be used to trick someone into thinking it is a safe tool to use. Use real hashing and encryption algorithms like SHA-256 if you need to create a hash for something. Modifying this code for malicious purposes such as to steal passwords or trick others into using it for real hashing is not acceptable and should not be done. It should be used as an example to learn how hashing may work and what hashing alrgorithms are trying to do.
